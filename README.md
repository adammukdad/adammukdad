# Hi, I'm Adam Mukdad  

🔐 **Entry-Level Identity & Access Management (IAM) Analyst** with a foundation in IT support and a passion for securing how people access technology.  
I design and build **practical IAM and cloud security solutions** that automate access governance, strengthen zero-trust architectures, and simplify lifecycle management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.  

My focus is on bridging usability and security — ensuring every identity, policy, and permission is both functional and compliant.
