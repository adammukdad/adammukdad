# Hi, I'm Adam Mukdad  

☁️ I design and build practical **cloud security tools** that solve real-world challenges in visibility, auditing, and access control. My work ranges from lightweight log analysis scripts to enterprise-grade multi-cloud threat intelligence platforms and secure deployment pipelines.
